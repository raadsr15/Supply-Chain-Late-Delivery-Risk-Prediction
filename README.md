# Supply Chain Late Delivery Risk Prediction (ML)

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning system to predict whether an order will be delivered late using real-world supply chain and logistics data. The goal is to help organizations identify high-risk shipments in advance and understand the operational factors that contribute to delivery delays.

The project focuses on clean data preprocessing, leakage-safe target creation, and systematic benchmarking of multiple classification models rather than complex deep learning, making it practical and industry-oriented.
